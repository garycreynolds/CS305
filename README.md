    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Aretemis Financial is a financial consulting company. The were in need of help modernizing and securing their data and how they sent and recieved information.
    
    What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    I think one thing that I did well was understanding the need for the most secure, usably protection possible. Coding securely is paramount to a company like this because they deal with a lot of sensitive information and any security breaches could cost the company a lot of money. It would also expose it's customers to a lot of risk. Software security is crucial to maintaining the trust that potential customers would need in a financial company.
    
    
    What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
    The part that was the most challenging to me was probably figuring out what was important and needed to be flagged and what was not. 
    
    
    How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
    I learned through this course that security is something that needs to be considered at every stage of development. In the future I would make sure that from the initial conversation with a client and every step moving forward, that security is at the forefront. Using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram has been a big help to me and it will be a tool that I use in the future.
    
    
    How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    To ensure that the code was functional and secure I made sure to test again and run another dependency check. When changing code it is important to know what vulnerabilities may have been added in.
    
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    Learning how to create certificates and how to run dependecy checks is something that I will most likely need throughout my career. I also mentioned previously that I intend on using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram in the future as well.
    
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
    The ability to interpret a client's needs and understand the security risks and how to mittigate those. These are incredibly valuable skills that I am already trying to grow in my current internship.
